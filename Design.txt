Design Implementation of the HANGMAN Game

The model contains a list of words when a new game is created. The words that I put in the list do not have repeated letters
to keep the whole design simple.

A cron job to send emails to users who have registered but have no wins yet has been implemented.
This is done to motivate the players to increase their rank and score with respective to their competitors.
