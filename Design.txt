Design Implementation of the HANGMAN Game

The model contains a list of words when a new game is created. I have manually inserted them and
have avoided using the same letter twice in a word since i will then have to implement more complex code
to handle that condition. The number of attempts provided to the user is double the length
of the respective target words. To improve the design, date can be retrieved from a database
and an algorithm can be implemented to have two letters in a word.

A cron job to send emails to users who have registered but have no wins yet has been implemented.
This is done to motivate the players to increase their rank and score with respective to their competitors.

Unfortunately there is no user authentication for this system. The person playing needs to just enter his/her
username into the system.

For further development of this game, developers could try implementing two letters for a guess word and also
User Authentication.
